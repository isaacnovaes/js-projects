# Joke Generator app

This is my first joke generator app. Also, it was the first time I used asynchronous JS in a project. While learning async JS, the async/await turned to be easier to work with solved promises than the thenables. So in this project, I used async/await to deal with the promise response from a fetch call of the [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/). I liked this project because I could practice asynchronous JS!
