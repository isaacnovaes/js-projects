### The project

A simple to-do list project, where I can practice my JS skills, along side with what I have recently learned, localStorage.

### Continued development

It was great to finish this project! Before, I feared localStorage, because I thought it would be hard to deal with it. However, while coding this project, I realized that it was quite easy to manipulate data stored locally.
