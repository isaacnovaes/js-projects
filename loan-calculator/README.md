## Overview

### The project

A simple compound loan calculator, where I can practice my JS skills, mainly DOM manipulation.

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS animation
- JavaScript

### Continued development

It was easier than [my previous project](https://isaacmyfirsttodolist.netlify.app/), [repo](https://github.com/isaacnovaes/js-projects/tree/main/todo-list-with-localStorage). However, I found it nice to practice DOM manipulation, which is something really important from my point of view, because it provides endless possibilities for designing a project.
